Thou Shalt Not Repeat The Sin Of The Golden CalfThou Shalt Not Deify Any Part Of Creation</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div style="text-align: left;"> <p>To the Honorable Rabbi Neventzal, Shlit&#8221;a,</p> <blockquote><p>I have a friend who is connected to the Chabad [Lubavitch] movement [and even though I stress that he does not represent all of Chabad, nevertheless there are others who hold his opinions]  and according to his views, all the created world is part of the Holy One Blessed Be He. In his view, in reality much of the Christian interpretation of the Bible is true and correct, however, they chose a wicked man and not a righteous man. That is to say, that in his view, the great Tzaddikim [righteous people] have succeeded in removing the barriers that hide how everything is the Holy One Blessed Be He and therefore there is no prohibition to pray to them. And in regard to what Ramban said in his disputation with the Christians, this was just propaganda.<br /> His intent to what Ramban said: &#8220;That the main principle and argument between the Jews and the Christians is the fact that you believe a dogma concerning the divinity which is very bitter&#8230; The thing which you believe in and it is a dogma of your faith, is not acceptable to one&#8217;s intellect, and nature does not permit it and the prophets never said so, nor can a wonder spread itself out to this matter&#8230; that the Creator of Heaven and Earth would be a fetus in the belly of a Jewish woman and would grow there&#8230; and that he would be born small and afterwards grow and afterwards would be handed over to his enemies&#8230; no reasoning Jew nor any man can tolerate this, and for naught and for vanity do you speak your words [letter 47 in the disputation, in accordance to the division in the writings of Ramban with the commentary of Rabbi Chavel].</p></blockquote> <p>Now a &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">proof </span>&#8221; for my friend&#8217;s opinion is found in the writings of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, head of Chabad.</p> <blockquote><p>    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;Just as Israel, the Torah, and the Holy One Blessed Be He are all one, not just that Israel is connected to the Torah and the Torah is<br /> connected to the Holy One Blessed Be He, rather, indeed they are truly one &#8211; so too the connection between the Chassidim to their Rebbe; it is<br /> not like 2 things that unify, rather they all become truly one. And the Rebbe in not an </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8216;intermediary that interferes</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8216;  but rather </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8216;an<br /> intermediary that attaches</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8216;.<br /> Therefore also for the Chassid: he and the Rebbe and the Holy One Blessed Be He &#8211; </span>{are} <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">one&#8230; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" /><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">And for this reason there is no room for the question concerning an </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8216;intermediary</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8216;, for this is self and the essence itself in accordance to what he placed to<br /> rest of himself in a body.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" /><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> And there in comment 56, the Rebbe adds, &#8220;I saw masters of the revealed </span>[non-kabbalistic] <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Torah raised a question against this and with a great<br /> tumult: Can it be, etc. etc. however a similar idea is </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">explicit</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> also in the revealed parts of the Torah. And it is as the Yerushalmi </span>[or perhaps the text of his words are that it is written <span style="font-weight: bold;">in the </span>Yerushalmi] <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Becurim chapter 3, halacha 3: &#8216;And G-d is in his holy sanctuary, this is Rabbi Yitzchak son of Lazar in the assembly of the<br /> study hall of Kisrin</span> {probably Caesaria}&#8217; &#8220;.     [Here Ends the quote of the words of Rabbi Schneerson.]</blockquote> <p>Now I looked in Ein Yaacov on the relevant passage from the Yerushalmi cited above and the text that appears in Ein Yaacov is slightly different. It says there, <span style="font-weight: bold;">behold </span>Rabbi Yitzchak son of Lazar and it is not written <span style="font-weight: bold;">this is </span>{Rabbi Yitzchak son of Lazar}. And he who analyzes that section from the Yerushalmi will see that the Yerushalmi is criticizing those who appointed [because of money], lousy judges and did not choose Rabbi Yitzchak son of Lazar, the righteous sage as a judge.</p> <p>Now according to the commentary of HaKotev there, the intent of the statement, &#8220;And G-d is in his holy sanctuary&#8221; = &#8220;be silent before him, all of the land and he will in the future bring retribution against those who transgress his will&#8221;. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For behold</span> you were supposed to have chosen, Rabbi Yitzchak son of Lazar, and not a lousy judge or judges.</p> <p>Now a second explanation of the Yerushalmi is the following. Many times in the Bible and in the sayings of the Sages the good actions of the righteous, the agents of the Holy One Blessed Be He, are described as the actions of the Holy One Blessed Be He. And the intent is not that they are actually from the Holy One Blessed Be He, but rather they are just from his agents. And so too here. The Yerushalmi wanted to inform us that Rabbi Yitzchak son of Lazar, is a capable agent of the Holy One Blessed to perform the mission of bringing justice to the world, in contrast to the lousy judges that received their tasks because of money.</p> <p>Now perhaps my friend can still be judged as a sinner by mistake, (&#8220;shogeig&#8221;, in Hebrew, which makes the sin and the punishment less severe) for he said that if the Sanhedrin will rule against his opinion, he is willing to abide by their ruling. And still another point to bring in his defense is that he mistakenly believes that he has the approval of the Tanna, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai for his opinions, based on a specific interpretation of the Kabbala.</p> <p>In light of his words I decided to investigate the viewpoint that everything is the Holy One Blessed Be He, for this viewpoint has penetrated into much of the religious world that aren&#8217;t connected at<br /> all with Chabad.<br /> Now I have a number of goals for this letter. Is it fitting to publicize my conclusion that <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is not correct to believe that the created world = part of the Holy One Blessed Be He.</span></p> <p>Secondly, I have a practical question. I work in the office of a certain Yeshiva [for a salary] whose rabbis hold the viewpoint  in accordance with the view of Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin that from the aspect of the ultimate truth, everything is the Holy One Blessed Be He, however, we have the obligation to relate to the Holy One Blessed Be He as something separate from the created world [and they also teach there with affection the viewpoint of the Chassidim]. Given this situation, is it permissible for me in a general way to help the Yeshiva?

however there is an aspect of the association [or partnership] of the name of heaven with something else which is more severe than just recounting the name of idols.<br /> And it is clarified, that a doubt never entered into the minds of our rabbis that it and those who serve it should have the status of idol worship, although they believe in a Creator of Heaven, for all that worship something that was created and attribute to it, an independent will [or free choice] and dominion, this is the main aspect of idolatry&#8221;.</p></blockquote> <p>In a similar fashion the Chafetz Chaim wrote in Sefer Mitzvot Hakatzar, Mitzvah 2:</p> <blockquote><p>It is a positive precept to attribute to the G-d, may he be blessed, an absolute state of being one; to believe with complete faith that he is one without any partner&#8230;<br /> One must believe with complete faith that he is simple with the utmost state of being one and an absolute unity and has no body, nor will the factors that affect  the body affect him, nor will occurrences of the body occur to him, and there is no second to him and outside of him, there is no L-rd; and we are obligated to believe this principle of faith at all times and at all moments and the commandment is a requirement both for males and females.</p></blockquote> <p>The Sephardic Poseik, the &#8220;Ben Ish Chai&#8221; in the responsa, Rav Paalim, Vol. I, Orach Chaim, chapter 1:</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;The end of the matter, all is heard, G-d is one and his name is one, and he does not have a body, nor a semblance of a body, and he has no form, nor picture, nor anything that compares to him at all&#8221;.</p></blockquote> <p><a name="999"></a></p> <p>It is implied to me from the words of the Poskim that it is forbidden to claim that all the world = a part of the Holy One Blessed Be He, for by this, one is  essentially denying the principle that the factors that affect the body do not affect him, nor will occurrences of the body occur to him.</p> <h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3333ff;

Now this is a quote of the Vilna Gaon: &#8220;For they are a generation that have brazenly lifted up their eyes and words against the One Most High, do they utter: &#8216;These are your gods, Israel, every tree and every stone&#8217;&#8230; and they reveal interpretations [lit. faces] of the<br /> Torah that are not in accordance with the halacha on the verse, &#8216;Blessed be the glory of G-d from his place&#8217; and on the verse, &#8216;and you bring life to all of them&#8217; &#8220;.Now in the Book by Volansky {or maybe the English transliteration is Wolansky}  an even harsher statement attributed to the Vilna Gaon is brought:<br /> [Translators note: The following 3 paragraphs will not be translated, since I am afraid that people who don&#8217;t understand Hebrew, might take these words out of context.

Even Shmuel, Mossad Harav Kook, 5742} [And so too the Rashba writes in Minchat Kenaot, chapter 6, that he agrees with the words of Rambam] ; from there it is clear that they considered the creation as separate from the Holy One Blessed Be He. &#8211; For those that do not have access to the internet, there Rabbi Saadia Gaon attacks the viewpoint that the Holy One Blessed Be He created the world from his own essence (and one should comment that Rabbi Menachem Kasher, in his work, Torah Shlaima, siman 15 forgot to mention this point).<br /> And it is reasonable to assume that Ramban and Radak agreed that the Holy One Blessed Be He did not create the world from his own essence for Radak in his commentary to the first verse in the Torah writes: &#8220;And so too did the L-rd create the heaven and the earth, he created them from nothing&#8221;&#8230; &#8220;he said all of the world, this is by my name, that they will say I have created it, that it to say that I extracted from a state of nothingness to existence&#8221; {end of quote}.</p> <p>And so too Ramban wrote in his commentary to the first verse of the Torah, &#8220;The Holy One Blessed Be He created all the creations from an absolute nothingness. And there is nothing in the Holy Language [Biblical Hebrew] that describes the extraction of something from nothing except for the word or concept ברא {pronounced in English as: <span style="font-style: italic;">Bara</span>}&#8221;. An additional reason to assume that Radak and Ramban and many of the other Rabbis in the category of the Rishonim,  intended to negate the concept that the Holy One Blessed Be He created the world from his own essence was that they used the term that Rabbi Saadia Gaon used, creation ex-nihilo [יש מאין] . It is unlikely that they would use this term of Rabbi Saadia, unless they agreed with him.<br /> Now this is a quote of Rabbi Saadia:</p> <p>&#8220;and the third viewpoint is the viewpoint of the person that said that the Creator of the bodies created them from his own essence. And I found that these people can&#8217;t deny the maker, however, it was not acceptable in their opinion according to what they imagine that creation can come to be from nothing [creation ex-nihilo]. And since there is no detail outside of the Creator, they assumed in their minds that he created all the things from his essence.<br /> [A refutation of the third viewpoint] <strong>Now these individuals, let the Almighty have mercy on you, are more foolish than the first ones. And I saw fit to reveal their foolishness in 13 ways</strong>&#8220;.</p> <p>And afterwards I discovered other explicit supporters of Rabbi Saadia. In Sefer Haplia on the words starting <span style="font-style: italic;">Yara Even Pinata</span>:</p> <blockquote style="font-face: 14px; font-family: CALIBRI, COURIER NEW;"><p>&#8220;<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">There is no escape {my comment: the intent is according to the opponents} from one of 2 possibilities, either there was eternal matter from which the world was invented both above and all that fills it or there wasn&#8217;t material at all but rather the ultimate cause of all causes {or ultimate catalyst} was alone.</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" /> <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><br /> If we respond to him that there was something there that is eternal, behold you verify that there is something eternal outside of G-d alone and if so this is a denial of our religion, and if we respond to him that there wasn&#8217;t anything.

The meaning of this: with the power {or force} of Wisdom and with the power {or force} of Understanding did the world come into existence</big>&#8221; {end of quote of Raavad}.</p> <p>I will not hide the fact that Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook who founded Mercaz HaRav Kook Yeshiva  in 5684 (1924), considered both &#8220;the monotheistic view&#8221; as well as the &#8220;Monotheistic outlook that leans towards Pantheism, <span style="font-weight: bold;">when it is refined from its dross&#8221; </span>as Kosher [Orot Hakodesh volume 2 pages 399, 400]. And seemingly he himself, held more or less in accordance with the view of Rabbi Chaim<br /> of Volozhin {Rabbi Tzuriel brought a proof to this (Kvatzim, Kovetz 1, Piska 65)}. Now perhaps Rabbi Kook gave validity to the &#8220;second outlook&#8221; that I recounted, for many of his legal rulings clearly have<br /> Kabbala and Agada integrated within them, which is a method that deviates from the classic Ashkenazic responsa [ thus wrote Rabbi Neriya Gutel in a general  appraisal of Rabbi Kook&#8217;s rulings]. Now one should note that also Rabbi Kook admits [in his article in Orot Hakodesh] that the viewpoint that is more famous in Israel is the monotheistic viewpoint.<br /> And elsewhere Rabbi Kook strongly hints that the &#8220;Monotheistic outlook that leans towards Pantheism&#8221;, just became accepted by a community of significance in Israel after the time of the apostate,<br /> Spinoza. For behold, Rabbi Kook wrote regarding Spinoza:</p> <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Within an inner layer of his thought there is a fundamental principal that after much refining enters into the camp.

Such is implied from an article that dealt with the topic, how by mistake Log Ba&#8217;omer was transformed from the day of happiness of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai to the day of his death.</p> <p>Recently it became known that a photocopy containing passages from the original handwriting of Rabbi Chaim Vital made it by some way to the National Library of Israel in Givat Ram. Armed by means of the photocopy, Rabbi Kosman came to the Library and after a strenuous examination of the original handwritten text, he succeeded in finding the relevant passage and found the passage that was subject to dispute. Now it was clarified beyond any doubt that the true text is indeed what appears in the book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Shmona Sh&#8217;earim</span>.<br /> Now it was possible to reconstruct the chain of errors that led to the errant text. A comparison between the various editions and between another early ancient handwritten addition in the Oxford Library teaches us that the scribal error was caused as a result of copying from a handwritten text, with the words: &#8220;the reason שמ&#8217;<span style="color: white;">0 </span><br /> [  a Hebrew abbreviation] Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai on Lag Ba&#8217;Omer is because &#8230;&#8221;<br /> The person that copied the text chose to decipher the abbreviation to mean <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-style: italic;">the day  he died</span> and such he wrote down, while according to the truth he should have deciphered the abbreviation  to stand for, <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-style: italic;">for the day of joy of </span>. It turned out that the day of joy of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was transformed by an error to the day of death of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai.<br /> How did it occur that such a fundamental copying mistake took place? The Chid&#8221;a himself already offered a hint to the answer and thus he wrote, &#8220;and it is already known that among the texts attributed to the Ari {short for Arizal} there fell confusion&#8221;&#8230; Behind this vague statement is hidden a concealed or unknown historical event. It turns out that after the Holy Ari died, Rabbi Chaim Vital contacted all his disciples and gathered from them the writings that were in their hands with the reasoning that the fit time had not yet arrived to reveal the secrets. The writings were all gathered under his hand {guard and control}for the duration of 15 years. One of the sages of Tzfat {Safed} by the name of Yehoshua Bin Nun pleaded with him that he would be allowed to look at the manuscripts but Rabbi Chaim Vital rejected his request and said that the time had not yet arrived. When Rabbi Chaim Vital was extremely ill and was taken to Damascus, Rabbi Yehoshua exploited the opportunity and paid Rabbi Chaim Vital&#8217;s brother 50 gold coins in order to allow him to copy the manuscripts. He brought 100 scribes who worked during a 3 day period and they copied all the manuscripts. In this hasty copy, which was made without the knowledge of Rabbi Chaim Vital, many mistakes and errors were introduced and it is no wonder that also in the detail dealing with Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was written in a short way. A matter which led to the story, as if the day of the death of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai is on Log Ba&#8221;Omer.</p> <p>The Mishna that appears in tractate Brachot 33b states that he who says {in the Shmona Esrei prayer} &#8230; Modim, Modim [in English, we give thanks to you, we give thanks to you] we silence him. The Talmud<br /> commented: &#8220;it is understandable Modim, Modim {should not be stated} since it appears &#8220;as if there are 2 authorities&#8221; {by making such a statement}. In his commentary on these words of the Mishna, starting<br /> with the words Modim, Modim, Rabbi Ovadia of Bartenura explained: &#8220;that it appears as if he is accepting 2 gods&#8221;. This implies that the prohibition of 2 authorities = 2 gods. However, there is <span style="font-weight: bold;">no prohibition</span><br /> of 2 authorities, for someone who holds that there is a partner to the Holy One Blessed Be He in good deeds, who is not a god, rather just a person. As explained in Tosafot to Sanhedrin 63a on the words that<br /> start with &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">All that associate the name of heaven</span>&#8220;. &#8220;It is not comparable to what was written {in Shoftim/Judges 7:20} &#8216;<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A sword for G-d and for Gidon</span>&#8216; and so too, &#8216;<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">we have spoken against G-d and against you</span>&#8216; (Bamidbar/Numbers 21:7) for it is only prohibited  in matters relating to being a god&#8221;. That is to say that as long as they don&#8217;t ascribe something outside of G-d by the name of a god there is no violation of the prohibition of making a partnership or association with G-d with something else. I brought all this because there are Jews who say that all the creation = The Holy One Blessed Be He and <span style="font-weight: bold;">they claim</span><br /> that on the contrary, to believe that there exists something outside of the Holy One Blessed Be He is the prohibition of service of a G-d who is associated with something else.</p> <p>In the supplement section to the book of Shmot/Exodus in the work of Rabbi Menachem Kasher, Torah Shleima, siman 15 we learn: <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">that the viewpoint of the Vilna Gaon on the explanation of the words &#8220;the whole earth is filled with his glory&#8221;, is a reference to his providence as described in Lkutei Hagra that were printed at the end of Safra Dtsniuta page 38a (Vilna 5642).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" /><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> However the disciple of the Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, though he admired his Rabbi as if he were one of the Tana&#8217;im {Rabbis of the Period of the Mishna} on this point he did not follow after the his<br /> {rabbi&#8217;s} viewpoint. Those who deeply investigate Shaar 3, of his work, Nefesh Hachaim will clearly see that he read </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Sefer Hatanya</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> {written by the founder of the Chabad or Lubavitch Chassidic movement} and<br /> accepted that author&#8217;s view in </span><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">almost</small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> all details.</span></p> <p>One should comment that even according to Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin who holds that on the level of the absolute truth, even after the creation of the world, in a way that is not understood by us, there is no<br /> material or existence outside of him {G-d}; however, he too admits that for every single matter and issue, we from our part, are obligated to relate to the Holy One Blessed Be He, as separate from the created<br /> world; see for example, Shaar 3, chapter 6.</p> <p>Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin for the most part bases his viewpoint on his explanation to the wisdom of Kabbala. And I have already brought as &#8220;a remedy to the plague&#8221;, the words of the Mishna Brura siman 25 comment 42: &#8220;<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">the Knesset Hagdola wrote as a principle of the Poskim that whenever the Kabbalists and the Zohar argue against the Gemara and the Poskim go after the Gemara and the Poskim</span>&#8220;, {end of quote}.</p> <p>Now I have already brought in the beginning of this article, that according to Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Ramban, Rashba, and more, even on the level of the absolute truth, there is a difference between the Holy One Blessed Be and the Created World.</p> <p>In the book <span style="font-style: italic;">Kashrut Arbaat Haminim</span>, page 194 [<span style="font-style: italic;">Chelek HaIyuni</span>,siman 7] it is brought:</p> <p>Howbeit in the responsa of Tuv Taam and in the opinion of Rabbi Shlomo Kluger&#8230;it is written explicitly that one should not rely on the examination of a magnifying glass, not to be lenient nor to be strict. And he brought a proof from the fact that according to the scientists in all water there are unseen bacteria; will all the water become forbidden because of this? And so too in every knife used for slaughtering, by means of a magnifying glass, defects {in the knife&#8217;s smooth edge} will be seen; would we invalidate it because of this?<br /> On a practical level the poskim have already decided and ruled that viewing from a magnifying glass does not alter the halacha, and all that according to the eye appears to be a deficiency, even though by magnifying glass, the deficiency isn&#8217;t seen, behold this is invalid; see the responsa Dovaiv Maisharim, siman 1 on the matter of a letter which does not look like it is surrounded by parchment, except when one looks in a magnifying glass, that it is invalid. And see in the responsa of She&#8217;airit Yisrael of the Rabbinic Genius, Z. Mintzberg.</p> <p>Now according to all of this, it is implied that even if you were to claim, that according to the absolute truth in reality all the material of this world is part of the Holy One Blessed Be He,<span style="font-style: italic;"> that truth</span> would be pushed away in favor of the halachic reality that established the opposite is true.</p> <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #3333ff; font-weight: bold;">How<br /> In Truth Can A Person Explain the Verses of the Hebrew Bible that the<br /> Other Side Brought as Proofs For Their Viewpoint?</h3> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><big><span style="color: red;">You have been shown, so that you know that G-d is the L-rd, there is no other beside him.</span><br /> (Dvarim / Deut. 4:35)</big></td> <td style="vertical-align: top;">In the commentary of Kli Yakar to Shmot /Exodus 7:17, it is written regarding the ten plagues, regarding the last set of 4 plagues [which the Passover Hagadda] called by the Abbreviation B.A.CH.B., Rabbi Yitzchak Abarbanel explained that they came to verify the ability of G-d, may he be blessed. But it appears to me that Pharoah claimed that there were 2 authorities; therefore it was stated in the first plague of this set B.A.CH.B.<br /> &#8220;in order that you know that there is none like me on Earth&#8221;. That is to say, there <span style="color: red;">is no other beside him</span>, May G-d Be Blessed, namely, no other authority.<br /> And so it appears to me that also according to the commentaries of the Netziv and the Malbim to Dvarim / Deuteronomy 4:35, one should explain &#8220;<span style="color: red;">there is no other beside him</span>&#8221; as a negation of the concept of 2 authorities [each one expresses this idea in his own style].<br /> It is implied to me from Rashi&#8217;s commentary to this verse [Dvarim / Deut. 4:35] that he agreed that the intent of &#8220;<span style="color: red;">there is no other beside him</span>&#8221; is to negate the concept of 2 authorities. However, in his opinion, the proof that <span style="color: red;">&#8220;there is no other beside him</span>&#8220;, is not from the ten plagues,<br /> but rather from the revelation of the Torah to Israel at Mount Sinai.As it is written there: &#8220;that when the Holy One Blessed Be He gave the Torah, he opened up for them, the seven heavens and just as he tore open the upper realms so too did he tear open the lower realms and they saw that he is single, therefore it was stated you have been shown, so that you know&#8221;.From the words of the Talmud, tractate Chulin page 7, it is implied that the expression &#8220;<span style="color: red;">there is no other beside him</span>&#8220;, comes to inform us, that if we have merits, the system or order of sorcery that G-d himself produced to deny his heavenly entourage, will not be able to harm; just as the system of sorcery did<br /> not harm, at the time of the ten plagues, and at the time of the sorcerer, Bilaam. Now here I will quote:<br /> &#8220;<span style="color: red;">There is no other beside him</span>&#8220;, Rabbi Chanina said, even sorcery &#8220;{end of quote}.The Talmud afterwards explained, that there was a witch that tried to perform witchcraft against Rabbi Chanina. And he responded, that the witchcraft did not succeed against him, &#8220;<span style="color: red;">there is no other beside him</span>&#8220;. The Talmud asked, behold, did not Rabbi Yochanan<br /> say, that these matters are called witchcraft {or sorcery}because [the name for these things in Hebrew imply that] they deny his heavenly entourage? {That is to say, that it is implied that witchcraft/sorcery do have the ability to cause harm}. The Talmud answers, Rabbi Chanina is different, for his merit is great.<br /> In Rambam&#8217;s opinion as recorded in Hilchot Yesodei Torah chapter 1, halachas 3 and 4, the purpose {in summary} of &#8220;<span style="color: red;">there is no other beside him</span>&#8221; is to come and negate the Greek notion, that the world or that matter is eternal. And the Rambam established &#8220;that all those that are present need him, and He, Blessed Be He, does not need<br /> them nor even one of them, therefore his truth is not like the truth of one of them&#8221;. {The commentary of Rambam La&#8217;am explains: the existence of the rest of the things that exist is not of absolute necessity, for they are dependent upon others, namely, by the reason that caused them to come to be &#8211; therefore they are just possible<br /> existence: it is possible that they endure and it is possible that they do not endure; however the first presence which is before every other thing that doesn&#8217;t have a cause for its existence, this existence is a necessity&#8230;} Now one should comment in the Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah, Rambam did not go to the trouble to explain, what did<br /> the nation of Israel, see (&#8220;<span style="color: red;">you have been shown, so that you know</span>&#8220;) that proved that there is no eternal matter which exists outside of the Holy One Blessed Be He (&#8220;<span style="color: red;">there<br /> is no other beside him</span>&#8220;).</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Blessed be the glory of G-d from his place.</span><br /> (Yechezkel/Ezekiel 3:12)</td> <td style="vertical-align: top;">Radak explained:<br /> <span style="color: red;">Blessed be the glory of G-d from his place</span>, that is to say that when he departs from his place above the ark cover between the two cherubs; for Israel was lessening his glory when he was among them with the image of jealousy that provokes jealousy {ie. an idol}(so it is) as if his glory was increased when he departed from them.<br /> Metzudat Dovid: &#8220;And I heard from behind me a voice with a great tremorous noise say,<span style="color: red;"> Blessed be the glory of G-d from his place</span>; as if saying to the prophet, do not think that when the Divine Presence departs from its place inside the Holy of Holies it will not be blessed and extolled; however, Israel they indeed will be the ones that are lacking when the Divine Presence departs from among them but the glory of G-d will continually be blessed and extolled.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="color: red;">If a man hides in the hidden places but shall I not see him, says G-d?

This is a reference to a light that was created.<br /> The Hebrew words  Ani Malay אני מלא in this verse of Yirmiyahu/Jeremiah 23:24 are to be understood as I fill. That is to say, that I am in every place. And this is just a parable, for the Holy One Blessed Be He, is not a body that fills space, rather his providence is in every place in the Heaven and the Earth and so too explains<br /> Targum Yonatan Ben Uziel, that the verse  {of Yirmiyahu/Jeremiah 23:24} tells us that his <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">glory </span></big>fills the Heaven and the Earth.<br /> Rabbi Saadia Gaon explains in his work,  <span style="font-style: italic;">Emunot V&#8217;Deot :</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">And I say: How shall we establish in our understanding his presence in all places, to the point where there is no place that is empty of him. Because he is prior to every place. And if the places would have separated between his parts, he would not have created them, and if there would be situation that the bodies would grab space in whole or partially, he would not have brought them into existence.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" /><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br /> Now since the matter is such, behold his existence after he created the bodies is like his existence before this, without change, unhidden, and without division.

This is, as it is stated, <span style="color: red;">&#8220;And to Eiver{Eber} was born two sons&#8221;, etc. <span style="color: black;">[Bereshit Rabba 37:7}.</span></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="color: red;">Behold there are days that will come, says G-d, and I will raise up for Dovid {David} a righteous sprout and he shall reign as king and act wisely and perform justice upon the Earth.

And this naming is in the same manner that Moshe {Moses} our Rabbi, peace be unto him, named the altar, {see Shmot/Exodus 17:15} &#8220;G-d is my banner {or some translate, my miracle}&#8221;. And Yaacov {Jacob} called the altar, Almighty the L-rd of Yisrael { [see Bereshit/Genesis 33:20]}. Each one according to the matter which was relevant to it.

For so we find concerning Dovid {David}, King of Yisrael {Israel}, who learned only two things from Achitophel and yet he called him his Rabbi, his Mentor, and his intimate friend, for it has been stated: &#8220;You are a man whose value is like my own, my Mentor {alt. translation: my General}, and my intimate friend&#8221; {Tehillim/Psalms 55:14}.</div> <div style="text-align: left;">Now, we may infer as follows: If Dovid {David}, King of Yisrael {Israel}, who learned only two things from Achitophel, addressed him as his Rabbi, Mentor, and intimate friend, how much more should one who learns from his companion, one chapter, one halacha, one verse, one statement, or even one letter, treat this one {who taught him} with honor.</div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
